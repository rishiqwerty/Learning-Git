# Full Text Search
You joined a new project. The project is going through some performance and scaling issues. After some analysis,  
the team lead asks you to investigate the possibility of using a different database for full text searching will improve performance.  
Investigate Elasticsearch, Solr and Lucene.

## There are various possibilities of performance slow down
1. __Elastic Search__: is a great search engine that helps retrieve data in near-real time and also helps store data efficiently to do so.
   But as data grows and complexity increases, we start seeing performance slow down.
2. __Solr__:
3. Lucene: Lucene is a high-performance, full-featured text search engine library written in Java.   
   It is a technology suitable for nearly any application that requires full-text search, especially cross-platform.
